### Frontend ✅ COMPLETE (Core Loop)
- [x] `App.jsx` — 3-view state machine
  - [x] View 1: Onboarding wizard + roadmap builder
  - [x] View 2: Prerequisites screen

  - [x] Back to roadmap button
  - [x] Course completion alert
- [x] `src/hooks/useCourseProgress.js` — localStorage progress hook

  - [x] `markTopicComplete(mi, ti, roadmap)` — save completion + advance location
  - [x] `jumpToTopic(mi, ti)` — navigate without resetting completion
  - [x] `getTopicState(mi, ti)` → `"locked" | "unlocked" | "current" | "completed"`
  - [x] `clearProgress()` — wipe on start over

  - [x] Quiz phase: MCQ + fill-blank + open-ended all rendered
  - [x] Submit answers → evaluation
  - [x] Results phase: per-question feedback + pass/fail banner
  - [x] Pass → Next topic button
  - [x] Fail → Re-study or Retry quiz buttons
  - [x] Skip topic button

### DB Wiring ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Neon schema fixed — courses/progress tables recreated with correct columns
- [x] Unique constraint on progress(session_id, course_id)
- [x] POST /api/progress/save-course — creates session + course, returns both IDs
- [x] POST /api/progress/save — upserts progress on topic complete
- [x] POST /api/progress/load — loads latest progress by session_id
- [x] frontend/src/utils/session.js — generates persistent session UUID
- [x] useCourseProgress.js — initProgress calls DB, markTopicComplete syncs to DB
- [x] App.jsx — initProgress is async, passes goal + level


### Next to Build — Active Learning (Highest Impact)

## Phase 3 — 3D Avatar 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Installed three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
- [x] Downloaded animated female teacher GLB from Sketchfab (nova.glb)
- [x] Built Avatar.jsx — loads GLB, plays animations based on mood prop
- [x] Added right panel (320px) in App.jsx for avatar
- [x] Avatar reacts to phase changes via onMoodChange callback from TopicView
- [x] Mood mapping: teaching→explaining, quiz→quiz, pass→happy, fail→concerned
- [ ] Push nova.glb to work on Vercel (currently only works locally)
- [ ] Test all mood transitions on live site

---

## Phase 4 — Voice + Polish + Deploy 🔒 NOT STARTED

- [ ] Groq Whisper voice input
- [ ] Spaced repetition reminders (7-day review badge in sidebar)
- [ ] Export progress as PDF
- [ ] Mobile sidebar — hamburger menu, slide-in drawer
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render
- [ ] README with demo GIF

## Gotchas (Bugs Fixed — Never Re-introduce)

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `uv init` created nested `.git` inside `backend/` | `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force backend\.git` |
| 2 | `load_dotenv()` not finding `.env` | Use `Path(__file__).parent / ".env"` explicit path |
| 3 | Groq returns code blocks with real newlines inside JSON strings | Custom `clean_json()` parser + fallback regex strip |
| 4 | `quiz_agent.py` had wrong content (circular import) | Rewrote file with correct content |
| 5 | `teaching.py` route file not created | Created manually via PowerShell `New-Item` |
| 6 | GitHub push rejected (remote had README) | `git push --force` |
| 7 | Hook destructuring placed before state declarations in App.jsx | Move all `useState` declarations above hook calls |
| 8 | Extra closing `</div>` in teaching mode JSX | Teaching mode needs exactly 2 closing divs: flex row + min-h-screen |
| 9 | `TopicView.jsx` committed to wrong location (`src/` instead of `src/components/`) | `git rm frontend/src/TopicView.jsx` |
| 10 | create_session called with wrong args (session_id passed as first arg) | DB generates session_id — call create_session(goal, level) only |
| 11 | await in onClick without async keyword | onClick={async () => { await ... }} |
| 12 | Vite serving stale bundle after file edits | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .vite then Ctrl+Shift+R |
| 13 | phase useState deleted accidentally causing ReferenceError | Always check useState declarations when adding useEffect that references state |
| 14 | Math.PI rotation shows model's back | Use rotation={[0, 0, 0]} for front-facing, small values like 0.1 for slight angle |
| 15 | GLB file in public/ not pushed to git due to size | Add nova.glb explicitly with git add frontend/public/nova.glb |

## Coding Rules (Follow Every Session)

1. Explain concept before writing code
2. One file at a time — build and test before next file
3. Never use `&&` in PowerShell — use separate lines
4. Always prefix Python with `uv run`
5. Run `uv run ruff check --fix` before every Python commit
6. Commit working code before extending
7. Update PROGRESS.md after every completed step
8. Add every new bug to Gotchas immediately
9. Never re-introduce a bug from the Gotchas list
10. Free tools only — approved stack above
11. PowerShell curl = `Invoke-WebRequest` — use `/docs` Swagger UI instead for API testing
